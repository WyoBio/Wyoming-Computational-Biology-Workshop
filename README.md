## Details

### Bulk RNA-Seq
This is the details section for Bulk RNA-Seq.

### Module 00
Details for Module 00 go here.

### Module 01
In this module, we will delve into the essentials of reference genome files (.fa), gene annotation files (.gtf), and raw sequence files (.fastq). We'll cover the necessary commands for downloading, understanding, indexing, and performing quality control on these files.

#### Introduction to Inputs
- ##### Reference genomes can be downloaded from Ensembl using the following links:
    - Mouse: [link]
    - Human: [link]
- ##### The Annotation files can be downloaded using the following links:
   - Mouse: [link]
   - Human: [link]
- ##### For the sake of time, we are going to perform the analysis using only a single chromosome (chr22) and the ERCC spike-in to make it run faster.
- ##### The input RNAseq (.fastq file) consists of two commercially available RNA samples:
   - Universal Human Reference (UHR): Total RNA from 10 diverse cancer cell lines.
   - Human Brain Reference (HBR): Total RNA from the brains of 23 Caucasians, male and female, of varying ages but mostly 60-80 years old.
