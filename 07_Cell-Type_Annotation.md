# Cell Type Annotation

### What's the importance of labeling cell types in single-cell RNAseq data?
Assigning cell type annotations in single-cell gene expression data is a dynamic area of research. This task is challenging due to two main factors:

- Gene expression levels often exist on a continuum rather than in discrete categories.
- Variations in gene expression don't always equate to functional differences between cells (Pasquini et al.).

The field is rapidly evolving with the introduction of various annotation tools and the development of multiple scRNA-seq databases (Wang et al.).

One effective approach for cell type annotation is utilizing web resources. These tools are user-friendly and do not require advanced scripting or programming skills. Notable examples include Azimuth, Tabula Sapiens, and SciBet. Researchers often employ multiple tools for cell type annotation to ensure accuracy. Additionally, it is advisable to validate annotations through experiments, statistical analyses, or consultations with subject matter experts.
